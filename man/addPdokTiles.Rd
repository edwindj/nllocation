\description{
This function adds PDOK tile layers to \code{\link[leaflet]{leaflet}}.
It is a small wrapper around \code{\link[leaflet]{addTiles}} that sets
the correct urls for the layers.
}
\details{
PDOK provides tiles that can be used as a tile layer in several
geovisualization tools including \code{leaflet}.
The layers differ from other tile layers such as Openstreetmap, Google and
cartomap in the following manner:
\itemize{
  \item The tiles are restricted to the Netherlands: tiles accross the Dutch
  border are "grayed out". This is useful for cartographic applications
  that are restricted to Dutch geo-information.
  \item The tiles are open source and based on open sourced geo-information.
}
