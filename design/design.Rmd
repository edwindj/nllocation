## Aim

Create an R interface to the PDOK Locatieserver API.     
Locatieserver is a (reverse) geocoding service for The Netherlands.    
Locatieserver is part of the Dutch National Spatial Data Infrastructure and hosted by [PDOK](http://www.pdok.nl).

## How do we name the package?
Suggestions:    

- pdokr    
- nllocation  
- dutchgeocoder    
- nlgeocoder     

Considerations:    

- The name should describe the functionality well    
- Users should see immediately that the package is only for geocoding addresses in the Netherlands    
- Maybe we want to create an interface to other PDOK functionality later, but for now we choose to create a compact package that only uses Locatieserver    
- Prefix 'nl' is better than 'dutch', because the package will only work for The Netherlands, not for other countries where Dutch is spoken.    
- The package should preferrably end with an 'r' ;-)   

## What license?

"As open as possible"

## Naming conventions

- Prefix functions with `nl_`

## Ideas

- Return the response as an `sf` object
- Use the `score` attribute as a thresshold value to determine if a search result should be returned to the user. If the score is too low, it is may not be a good fit.
- Mimic the `geocode` function in the `ggmap` package. For example, add a parameter `output` (`latlon`, `latlona`, `more`, `all`)
- Add a parameter to choose between returning the location in WGS84 or RD_New.
- Add a parameter to limit the number of rows returned with default value 1.
- Add a parameter to add the API key to the request. Apparantly not obligatory, but nice to have for PDOK to monitor API usage.

## Findings

- You can only do one-by-one requests to the Locatieserver, no bulk requests.
- What are the terms of use for Locatieserver?

## Tasks

- Create unit tests with `testthat` (Willy)
- Add documentation using Roxygen2
- Add functionality and make it more user-friendly  (Edwin)
- Create demo using tmap and shiny (Egge-Jan)
